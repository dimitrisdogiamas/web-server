## the project purpose is to develop a web server with express js and node js 


- this will give us some results about the stats we want to take from the api and help us fetch the data 
- we can store as many prices as we want 
- when the file is listening the file will be running all the time up and down 
- we want it to restart every time and that's why we made nodemon server.js 
- we use the post in express when we want to post and get if we want info
